The initial goal of the UmlQuick project is to automatically generate
message trace diagrams from a declarative QML form by instrumenting the
code being traced.  Perhaps other types of diagrams could be created in
QML too.  It was inspired by the UMLGraph project
http://www.umlgraph.org/doc/seq-intro.html but rewritten because I
wanted to try to use QML instead of gnu pic macros.

The code here is only for viewing the generated QML, and there are a couple
of examples.  Generating QML inside core parts of Qt depends on
https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,43201
and there is an example patch for qtbase to trace touch events here
https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,65307

It should work with Qt 5.2 or newer (due to some limited usage of
QtQuick.Controls).

uq is a script which simply runs qml with your given (possibly
generated) qml file containing the declarative UML diagram.  It can
optionally be added to your path.
